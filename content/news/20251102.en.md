Dear Members of the Boogon Agora Community,

We have been made aware that malicious actors are sending deceptive messages via SMS, social media, and instant messaging platforms. These messages often impersonate legitimate organizations or contacts and contain suspicious links designed to trick you into clicking, potentially leading to fraud and the compromise of your personal and financial information.

Your safety is our priority. Please take a moment to review these essential safety practices:

Stay Vigilant: Recognize the Risk

Verify the Source: Treat any unsolicited message containing a link with extreme caution, especially those claiming you have "won a prize," your "account has an issue," there is a "delivery problem," or a "system upgrade" is required.

Do Not Click: Never click on web links or scan QR codes from unverified or suspicious sources. These often lead to fake websites crafted to steal your login credentials, passwords, and other sensitive data.

Never Share Information: Legitimate organizations will never ask for your personal information, passwords, or verification codes via unofficial channels. Never enter your Boogon Agora password, verification codes, or other sensitive information on any website other than our official domains.

Our only official websites are:

- Main Site: [https://www.boogon.com](https://www.boogon.com)

- Documentation: [https://docs.boogon.com](https://docs.boogon.com)

If you are ever unsure about a link or message claiming to be from us, please contact us directly at [official@boogon.com](mailto:official@boogon.com) for verification.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation in helping to keep our community secure.
