In accordance with the long-term development plan of Boogon Reception Room, and to comprehensively enhance user experience, optimize service performance, and better align with future technological evolution, we are pleased to announce the initiation of a full-scale, in-depth reconstruction of the documentation site, scheduled to commence in **September 2025**. This overhaul will involve systematic improvements across technical architecture, functional modules, and user interface interactions. Below are the key details:

### Key Changes

##### 1. Technical Architecture Updates
+ Rendering Engine Migration: Transition to the `Hugo/Hextra` framework to rebuild the frontend interaction system;
+ Performance Optimization: Integration of CDN and other acceleration services to significantly improve page loading speed and reduce latency issues across regions;
+ Enhanced Security: Strengthened security measures to ensure service stability and reliability.
##### 2. Functional Module Adjustments
+ Documentation Restructuring: Consolidate all technical documentation into a unified **Dev Docs** module for improved modular management;
+ New Comment System: Official rollout of a request and feedback system powered by **GitHub Discussions**, with initial trial availability on select pages.
##### 3. User Experience Improvements
+ Simplified Routing Structure: Streamline complex URL hierarchies to make content discovery more intuitive and efficient;
+ Upgraded Links Display: Redesigned "Friends" page for clearer presentation of affiliated organizations and collaborators.

### Impact Notice

##### 1. Service Interruption Period
From **August 27, 2025** to **September 11, 2025** (tentative), the site will enter the reconstruction phase. During this time, access may be unstable or temporarily unavailable.
##### 2. Emergency Contact
For urgent inquiries, please reach out via [email](mailto:official@boogon.com "Click to send email").
##### 3. Compatibility Note
We recommend using modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Mobile layouts will also be optimized for better responsiveness.

This reconstruction marks the most comprehensive upgrade since the inception of the Boogon Reception Room Docs. While we acknowledge the temporary inconvenience this may cause, we believe it is a necessary step toward long-term service enhancement and value creation. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.
